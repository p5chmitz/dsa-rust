## Data Structures & Algorithms
This project contains mostly naive implementations of classical data structures written in Rust. Along the way it touches on many of the languageâ€™s usual growing pains: learning to live/laugh/love with the borrow checker, writing custom iterators, juggling reference counts, wrangling complex lifetimes and elision, and even dabbling in a bit of `unsafe`. Ultimately this project represents a personal journey of soup-brained defiance against the voice of reason.

## Contents & Documentation
This project also includes two primary bodies of documentation, including a rich suite of [API reference documentation](https://www.headyimage.com/docs/dsa_rust/index.html) with extensive explanations and examples, as well as higher-level, narrative-based [conceptual documentation](https://www.headyimage.com/cs/dsa/dsa-intro) that represents material you'd find in an intro to DSA course.
