## Data Structures & Algorithms
This is probably a terrible idea that Im going to regret, but what is life without a little spice?

This project relies on three primary sources consisting of _Data Structures & Algorithms in Java_ by Goodrich, Tamassia, and Goldwasser, _Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java_ (and an older edition in C) by Weiss, and _The Algorithm Design Manual_ by Skiena. With any luck I'll learn a thing or two _and_ retain my capacity for basic function in the process.
