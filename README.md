## Data Structures & Algorithms
This project contains mostly pedagogical implementations of classical data structures written in Rust. The material touches on many of the language’s common growing pains such as learning to live/laugh/love with the borrow checker, writing custom iterators, juggling reference counts, wrangling complex lifetimes and elision, and even dabbling in a bit of `unsafe`. Ultimately this project represents a personal journey of soup-brained defiance against the voice of reason.

## Contents & Documentation
The larger project includes two primary bodies of documentation: a rich suite of [API reference documentation](https://www.headyimage.com/docs/dsa_rust/index.html) with extensive explanations and examples that tie into Rust's testing framework, and a suite of categorical [narrative-based documentation](https://www.headyimage.com/cs/dsa/dsa-intro) that covers concepts similar to those found in an introductory DSA course.
