## Data Structures & Algorithms
This is probably a terrible idea that Im going to regret. Im here learn a thing or two, and with a bit of luck I'll retain my capacity for basic function in the process.

So much information has gone into making these implementations work, but these are the primary drivers of the content here:

<summary> Lists </summary>

The lists section centers around solutions to create a simple podium of sorted entries consisting of names and associated scores.


- Array list: A two-fer of dirt-simple array and Vector-based lists
- Singly-linked list: A simple, singly-owned, and safe linked list
- Doubly-linked list: A horribly unsafe linked list with just enough Miri testing to not immediately set the computer on fire

</details>

<details> 

<summary> Stacks </summary>

This section builds on the structures and approaches established in the Lists section.


- Vector-based: Simple and effective, likely the preferred approach
- Singly-owned linked list: Just because a implementing a stack with a safe, linked-list is possible

<summary> Algorithms </summary>

- Simple binary search

<details> 

<summary> Funsies </summary>

This section contains all the solutions to remedial problems and examples I collected along the way and liked enough to want to remember.


- Disk usage calculator
- Identifying unique elements in a Vector
- Calculate pre-fix averages of a Vector
- Simple factorial calculator
- Array reversal
- Fibonacci sequence calculator
- Tower of Hanoi solution
